# Let's Store Some Data

The localStorage and sessionStorage objects are implemented on the `window` object - so if you are writing code on the client side, you should be able to access them directly.

Git clone this [Example Repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/client-side-storage)

You'll notice that the app generates a high score when a button is clicked.

Using localStorage or sessionStorage, update the application so that:

  - The high scores persist when the users page is refreshed
  - The user can enter their name with their high score
  - The user can clear all high scores by clicking a button
  - The user can clear only high scores associated with their name
